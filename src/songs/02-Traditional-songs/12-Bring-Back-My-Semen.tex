\beginsong{The Dead Whore Song}[by={John Valby},li={John Valby is notoriously known for writing ``dirty'' lyrics}]
\beginverse
I fucked a dead whore by the road side
I knew goddamn well she was dead
The skin on her belly was yellow
There wasn't a hair on her head
\endverse

\beginverse
While thinking about my dilemma
I realised my terrible sin
So I placed my lips on her pussy
And sucked out the load I shut in
\endverse

\beginchorus
Bring back, bring back
O bring back my semen to me, to me
Bring back, bring back
O bring back my semen to me.
\endchorus
