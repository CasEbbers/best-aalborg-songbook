\beginsong{I Love Rock'n'Roll}[by={AC/DC}]
\beginverse
I saw him dancing there by the record machine
I knew he must have been about 17
The beat was going strong, playin my favorite song
I could tell it wouldn't be long 'till he was with me
Yeah me
I could tell it wouldn't be long 'till he was with me
Yeah me
\endverse

\beginchorus
Singing I love rock and roll
So put another dime in the jukebox baby
I love rock and roll
So come and take the time and dance with me 
\endchorus

\beginverse
He smiled so I got up and asked for his name
But that don't matter he said cuz it's all the same
He said can I take ya home, where we can be alone
And next we're moving on and he was with me
Yeah me
We were movin' on and singing that same old song
Yeah me
