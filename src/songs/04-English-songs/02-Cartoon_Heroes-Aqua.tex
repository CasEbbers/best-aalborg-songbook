\beginsong{Cartoon Heroes}[by={Aqua}]
\beginverse
We are what we're supposed to be 
Illusions of your fantasy 
All dots and lines that speak and say 
What we do is what you wish to do 
\endverse

\beginverse
We are the cartoon symphony 
We do the things you want to see 
Frame by frame, to the extreme 
\endverse 

\beginverse
Our friends are so unreasonable 
They do the unpredictable 
All dots and lines that speak and say 
What we do is what you wish to do
\endverse 

\beginverse
It's all an orchestra of strings, 
Doing unbelievable things 
Frame by frame, to the extreme 
One by one, we're making it fun
\endverse 

\beginchorus
We are the cartoon heroes, oh,
We are the ones who're gonna last forever 
We came out of a crazy mind, oh,
And walked out on a piece of paper 
\endchorus

\beginchorus 
Here comes Spiderman, an arachnophobian 
Welcome to the toon town party 
Here comes superman from never-never land 
Welcome to the toon town party
\endchorus
 
\beginverse
We learn to run at speed of light 
And to fall down from many heights 
It's true but just remember that 
What we do is what you just can't do 
\endverse

\beginverse 
I know the route of craziness 
A bunch of dots that's chasin' us 
Frame by frame, to the extreme 
One by one, we're making it fun 
\endverse

\beginchorus
We are the cartoon heroes\dots
\endchorus

\beginchorus 
Here comes Spiderman\dots
\endchorus

\beginverse
You'll think we're so mysterious 
Don't take us all too serious 
Be original, and remember that 
What we do is what you just can can't do  
\endverse

\beginverse 
(What we do is what you just can't do)
(What we do is what you just can't do) 
(What we do is what you just can't do) 
(What we do is what you just can't do)
\endverse

\beginchorus
We are the cartoon heroes\dots
\endchorus

\beginverse 
There's still more to come, 
And everyone will be 
Welcomed at the 
Toon (toon) 
Town (town) 
Party!
\endverse
