\beginsong{Back to the 80's}[by={Aqua}]
\beginverse
Back in the Ronald Reagan days
When we put satellites in space
When boys wore skinny leather ties
Like Don Johnson from Miami Vice
\endverse

\beginverse
When M\&M was just a snack
And Michael Jackson's skin was black
Back to the coolest thing in store
Was a commodore 64
\endverse


\beginchorus
Back to the 80's,
Back to soap
Back to Rocky and Cherry coke
Those were the days and we go back to 80's,
And hey there Mr. T
To Twisted Sisters on MTV, yeah
Those were the days
I come back... to Iron Maiden and 7UP
Whoa yeah... Bananarama and Breakfast Club
Come back... Yeah!
Come back... Yeah!
I come back...
\endchorus

\beginverse
When Huey Lewis was the news
When we went flying with Tom Cruise
When shoulderpads and looking tough
Was a dirty David Hasselhoff
\endverse

\beginverse
Too many man with heavy make-up on
Too many poodles with guitars
Thanks for all the joy you've given us
You will always be our superstars
\endverse

Hurray for Cosby and Rubik's Cube
Hurray for Dynasty and Moon Boots
Hurray for Devo and Barber Curls
Hurray for Poltergeist and Barbie Girls

\beginverse
Let's go back to the 80's, 7-up
We look at all the stars still standing tall
Let's go back to the 80's
Back to the 80's, back to the 80's, 7-Up
We look at all the stars still standing tall
Let's go back to the 80's\dots
