\beginsong{Yellow Submarine}[by={The Beatles}]\beginverseIn the town where I was bornLived a man who sailed to seaAnd he told us of his lifeIn the land of submarines\endverse\beginverseSo we sailed on to the sunTill we found the sea of greenAnd we lived beneath the wavesIn our yellow submarine\endverse\beginchorusWe all live in a yellow submarine,Yellow submarine, yellow submarineWe all live in a yellow submarine,Yellow submarine, yellow submarine\endchorus \beginverseAnd our friends are all aboardMany more of them live next doorAnd the band begins to play\endverse\beginchorusWe all live in\dots\endchorus \beginverseAs we live a life of easeEveryone of us has all we needSky of blue and sea of greenIn our yellow submarine.\endverse\beginchorusWe all live in\dots (repeat \rep{2})\endchorus \endsong
