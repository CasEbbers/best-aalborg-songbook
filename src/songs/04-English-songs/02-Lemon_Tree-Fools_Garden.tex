\beginsong{Lemon Tree}[by={Fools Garden}]
\beginverse
I'm sitting here in the boring room
It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon
I'm wasting my time
I got nothing to do
I'm hanging around
I'm waiting for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder
\endverse

\beginverse
I'm driving around in my car
I'm driving too fast
I'm driving too far
I'd like to change my point of view
I feel so lonely
I'm waiting for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder
\endverse

\beginchorus
I wonder how
I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon-tree
I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning turning turning turning turning around
And all that I can see is just another lemon-tree
\endchorus

\beginverse
I'm sitting here
I miss the power
I'd like to go out taking a shower
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head 
I feel so tired
Put myself into bed
While nothing ever happens and I wonder
\endverse

\beginverse
Isolation is not good for me
Isolation I don't want to sit on the lemon-tree
\endverse

\beginverse
I'm steppin' around in the desert of joy
Baby anyhow I'll get another toy
And everything will happen and you wonder
\endverse

\beginchorus
I wonder how
I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
And all that I can see is just another lemon-tree
I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning turning turning turning turning around
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon-tree
And I wonder, wonder
\endchorus

\beginchorus
I wonder how
I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
And all that I can see, and all that I can see, and all that I can see
Is just a yellow lemon-tree
\endchorus
