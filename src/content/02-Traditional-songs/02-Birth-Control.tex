\beginsong{Birth Control}[by={Yesterday melody}]
\beginverse
Birth control, is the only way to save my soul,
when I'm going up my girlfriend's hole,
Oh I believe, in birth control.
\endverse

\beginverse
Suddenly, there's a shotgun hanging over me,
it was unexpected pregnancy
Oh I believe, in birth control.
\endverse

\beginchorus
Why I had to come I don't know, she wouldn't blow.
I stayed in too long, now I long for birth control.
\endchorus

\beginverse
Syphilis, it all started with a little kiss,
now it hurts me when I try to piss,
Oh I believe in syphilis.
\endverse

[Chorus]

\beginverse
Leprosy, there are pieces falling off of me
I'm not half the man I used to be
Oh I believe in leprosy.
\endverse

[Chorus]
