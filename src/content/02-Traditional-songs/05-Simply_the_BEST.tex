\beginsong{Simply the BEST}[by={written by Mike Chapman \& Holly Knight}]
\beginverse
I call you when I need you and my heart's on fire,
You come to me, come to me wild and wired.
\endverse

\beginverse
Oh you come to me, give me everything I need,
You bring a lifetime of promises and a world of dreams,
You speak the language of love like you know what it means
And it can't be wrong, take my heart and make it strong.
\endverse 

\beginchorus
You're simply the best, better than all the rest,
Better than anyone, anyone I ever met.
I'm stuck on your heart, I hang on every word you said,
Tear us apart, baby, I would rather be dead.
\endchorus

\beginverse 
Deep in your heart I see the start of every night and every day,
And in your eyes I get lost, I get washed away.
Just as long as I'm here in your arms I could be in no better place\dots
\endverse

\beginchorus
You're simply the best, better than all the rest,
Better than anyone, anyone I ever met.
I'm stuck on your heart, I hang on every word you said,
Tear us apart, baby, I would rather be dead.
\endchorus
 
\beginverse
Each time you leave me I start loosing control
Walking away with my heart and my soul
I can feel you even when I'm alone, oh baby, don't let go!
\endverse

\beginverse 
'Cause you're simply the best, better than all the rest,
Better than anyone, anyone I ever met.
I'm stuck on your heart, I hang on every word you said,
Tear us apart, baby, I would rather be dead.
\endverse
