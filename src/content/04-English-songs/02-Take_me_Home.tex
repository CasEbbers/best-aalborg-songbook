\beginsong{Take Me Home, Country Roads}[by={John Denver}]
\beginverse
Almost heaven
West Virginia 
Blue Ridge Mountains
Shenandoah River
Life is old there
older than the trees 
younger than the mountains
blowin' like a breeze
\endverse

\beginchorus
Country roads
take me home 
to the place I belong
West Virginia
Mountain momma
take me home
my country roads
\endchorus

\beginverse
All my mem'ries 
gather round her
Miner's lady
stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty
painted on the sky
misty taste of moonshine
teardrop in my eye
\endverse

\beginchorus
Country roads\dots
\endchorus

\beginverse
I hear her voice in the morning hour 
she calls me
the radio reminds me of my home 
far away.
And drivin' down the road I get a feeling 
that I should have been home yesterday
yesterday
\endverse

\beginchorus
Country roads\dots
