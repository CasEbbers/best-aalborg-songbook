\beginsong{Pokemon}[by={written by John Siegler}]
\beginverse
I wanna be the very best,
Like no one ever was.
To catch them all is my real test,
To train them is my cause.
\endverse

\beginverse
I will travel across the land,
Searching far and wide.
Teach Pokemon to understand
The power that's inside
\endverse

\beginchorus
Pokemon, (gotta catch them all) its you and me
I know its my destiny
Pokemon, oh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend
\endchorus

\beginchorus
Pokemon, (gotta catch them all) a heart so true
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me and I'll teach you
(Po-ke-mon) Gotta catch 'em all
\endchorus

\beginverse
Every challenge along the way
With courage I will face
I will battle every day
To claim my rightful place
\endverse

\beginverse
Come with me, the time is right
There's no better team
Arm in arm we'll win the fight
It's always been our dream
\endverse
