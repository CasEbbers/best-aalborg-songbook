\beginsong{Stand by me}[by={Ben E. King}]
\beginverse
When the night has come, and the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we will see
No, I won't be afraid, oh, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me
\endverse

\beginchorus
So darlin', darlin' stand by me
Oh stand by me
Oh stand, stand by me, stand by me
\endchorus

\beginverse 
If the sky that we look upon should tumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry, no, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me
\endverse

\beginchorus
And darlin', darlin' stand by me
Oh stand by me
Whoa stand now, stand by me, stand by me
\endchorus

\beginchorus
And darlin', darlin' stand by me
Oh stand by me
Oh stand now, stand by me, stand by me
\endchorus

\beginchorus
Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me
Oh stand by me
Whoa stand now, oh stand, stand by me... 
\endchorus
