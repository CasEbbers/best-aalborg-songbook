\beginsong{What Makes You Beautiful}[by={One Direction}]
\beginverse
\textit{Only Liam}
You're insecure,
Don't know what for,
You're turning heads when you walk through the door,
Don't need makeup,
To cover up,
Being the way that you are is enough
\endverse

\beginverse
\textit{Only Harry}
Everyone else in the room can see it,
Everyone else but you
\endverse

\beginchorus
Baby you light up my world like nobody else,
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed,
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell,
You don't know,
Oh oh,
You don't know you're beautiful,
If only you saw what I can see,
You'll understand why I want you so desperately,
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe,
You don't know,
Oh oh,
You don't know you're beautiful,
Oh oh,
\textit{Only Harry}
That's what makes you beautiful
\endchorus

\beginverse
\textit{Only Zayn}
So girl come on,
You got it wrong,
To prove I'm right,
I put it in a song,
I don't know why,
You're being shy,
And turn away when I look into your eye eye eyes,
\endverse

\textit{Only Harry}
Everyone else in the room can see it,
Everyone else but you,
