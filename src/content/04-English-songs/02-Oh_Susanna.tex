\beginsong{Oh! Susanna}
\beginverse
I come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee, 
I'm going to Louisiana, my true love for to see. 
It rained all night the day I left, the weather it was dry 
The sun so hot I froze to death, Susanna, don't you cry.
\endverse

\beginchorus
Oh! Susanna, Oh don't you cry for me, 
For I come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee.
\endchorus

\beginchorus
I had a dream the other night, when everything was still; 
I thought I saw Susanna dear, a coming down the hill. 
A buckwheat cake was in her mouth, a tear was in her eye, 
Says I, I'm coming from the south, Susanna, don't you cry.
\endchorus

\beginchorus
I soon will be in New Orleans, and then I'll look around, 
And when I find Susanna, I'll fall upon the ground. 
But if I do not find her, then I will surely die, 
And when I'm dead and buried, Oh, Susanna, don't you cry.
\endchorus
