\beginsong{Highway To Hell}[by={AC/DC}]
\beginverse
Living easy, loving' free 
Season ticket, on a one - way ride 
Asking nothing, leave me be 
Taking everything in my stride 
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme 
Ain't nothing I would rather do 
Going down, party time 
My friends are gonna be there too 
\endverse

\beginchorus
I'm on the highway to hell 
On the Highway to hell 
Highway to hell 
I'm on the highway to hell
\endchorus

\beginverse 
No stop signs, speed limit 
Nobody's gonna slow me down 
Like a wheel, gonna spin it 
Nobody's gonna mess me 'round 
Hey Satan! Paid my dues 
Playin' in a rockin' band 
Hey Mama! Look at me 
I'm on my way to the promise land
\endverse

\beginchorus
I'm on the highway to hell 
Highway to hell 
I'm on the highway to hell 
Highway to hell 
\endchorus
 
\beginverse
Dont stop me!
\endverse

\beginchorus
I'm on the highway to hell! 
I'm on the highway to hell! 
I'm on the highway to hell! 
I'm on the highway to hell!  
\endchorus

\beginverse 
And I'm goin down\dots all the way! 
I'm on the highway to hell\dots
