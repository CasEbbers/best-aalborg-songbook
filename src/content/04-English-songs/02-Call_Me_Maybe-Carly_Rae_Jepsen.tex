\beginsong{Call Me Maybe}[by={Carly Rae Jepsen}]
\beginverse
I threw a wish in the well 
Don't ask me, I'll never tell 
I looked to you as it fell 
And now you're in my way 
\endverse

\beginverse
I trade my soul for a wish 
Pennies and dimes for a kiss 
I wasn't looking for this 
But now you're in my way 
Your stare was holding 
Ripped jeans, skin was showing 
Hot night, wind was blowing 
Where you think you're going baby? 
\endverse 

\beginchorus
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy 
But here's my number, so call me maybe 
It's hard to look right, at you baby 
But here's my number, so call me maybe
\endchorus

\beginchorus
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy 
But here's my number, so call me maybe 
And all the other boys, try to chase 
But here's my number, so call me maybe 
\endchorus

\beginverse 
You took your time with the call 
I took no time with the fall 
You gave me nothing at all, but still you're in my way 
I beg and borrow and steal 
At first sight and it's real 
I didn't know I would feel it, but it's in my way 
\endverse

\beginverse 
Your stare was holding 
Ripped jeans, skin was showing 
Hot night, wind was blowing 
Where you think you're going, baby? 
\endverse

\beginchorus
Hey, I just met you\dots
\textit{(repeat \rep{2})}
\endchorus
 
\beginverse
Before you came into my life I missed you so bad 
I missed you so bad... I missed you so, so bad 
Before you came into my life I missed you so bad 
And you should know that... I missed you so, so bad 
\endverse

\beginverse 
It's hard to look right, at you baby 
But here's my number, so call me maybe 
\endverse

\beginchorus
Hey, I just met you\dots
\endchorus

\beginverse 
Before you came into my life I missed you so bad 
I missed you so bad... I missed you so, so bad 
Before you came into my life I missed you so bad 
And you should know that 
So call me maybe
\endverse
